Trav_Well
=========


###Installation
Regardless of your OS you will need to set up a mysql database named "Trav_well". After this database is created, run the trav_well.sql script located in the root Trav_well directory to create the tables and input the data into the Trav_well database.

Also, ensure that the username and password of your Trav_well database match the username and password in applications/config/database.php

##Windows
To run our website, please go to Trav_well/application/controllers, and run the home.php

##Linux
To host the server simply enter the command: 'php -S localhost:<i>port</i> -t <i>path/to/rootdir</i>'



###Overview
We use codeigniter and bootstrap for this project.
Images are stored in assets/images.
All page layouts can be found in application/views.
There are controllers in application/controllers that control various functionality. home.php controls functions related to page loading. interaction.php controls user interactions such as messaging or adding friends. authorize.php contains the login system, and search.php contains search functionality.
All database actions are controlled by models in the application/models folder. These files are pretty straightforwardly named, although it should be noted that the difference between a place and a city is that a place is contained within a city. (i.e. a certain restaurant).
The actual layout of the web pages can be found in application/views. Again these should be pretty straightforwardly named.
